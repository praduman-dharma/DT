    php bin/magento deploy:mode:set developer

# Varnish Cache

Varnish is a powerful HTTP accelerator used in Magento 2 to improve page load times and reduce server load by caching full-page responses. Instead of processing every request through PHP and Magento, Varnish serves pre-cached pages to visitors, making the store significantly faster.

#  How Varnish Works in Magento 2

Magento 2 uses Full Page Cache (FPC) to store fully rendered HTML pages. It supports two caching methods:

-> Built-in cache (file system, database, Redis)
-> Varnish (recommended for production environments)

Varnish caches pages at the HTTP level, meaning Magento doesnâ€™t need to generate them every time a request is made.
