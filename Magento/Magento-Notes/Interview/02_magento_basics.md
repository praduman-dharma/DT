## ⚡ Varnish Cache in Magento 2

Varnish is a high-performance **HTTP accelerator** that dramatically improves page load speed by caching full-page responses.

### How It Works

Magento 2 Full Page Cache (FPC) supports:

* **Built-in caching** (file system, database, Redis)
* **Varnish** (recommended for production)

**Varnish** caches pages at the HTTP level so Magento doesn’t need to regenerate them for every request, significantly improving performance and scalability.
