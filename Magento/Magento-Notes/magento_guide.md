# Magento 2 Developer Guide

## Design Patterns & Concepts
- **Proxies**: Used to lazy-load objects and improve performance.
- **Source Model & Backend Model**: Define how data is fetched and saved in Magento.
- **Type vs. Virtual Type**:
  - Type: Defines a class in `di.xml`.
  - Virtual Type: Used to override dependencies without modifying the original class.
- **Difference Between Collection and Repository**:
  - Collections: Used for fetching multiple records from the database.
  - Repositories: Used as service contracts for CRUD operations.
- **Plugin and Types of Plugin**:
  - Before Plugin
  - After Plugin
  - Around Plugin
- **Abstract Class vs. Interface**:
  - Abstract classes can have implemented methods.
  - Interfaces only define method signatures.
- **Sort Order for Plugins**: Defines execution priority.
- **Creating a Custom Command**: Register a command in `di.xml` and implement `CommandInterface`.
- **Magento Execution Flow**: Defined in `registration.php`, `module.xml`, and `di.xml`.
- **Service Contracts**: API interfaces to ensure stability in custom modules.
- **Object Manager**: Used to instantiate objects but should be avoided in business logic.
- **Hard Dependency vs. Soft Dependency**:
  - Hard: Defined in `__construct()`.
  - Soft: Defined via `ObjectManager` or `Proxy`.
- **Plugin Execution Methods**: `Before`, `After`, `Around`.
- **Interfaces in API**: Used for defining structured APIs in Magento.
- **Ways to Override Files in Magento**:
  1. Preference (`di.xml`)
  2. Plugin
  3. Class Rewrite in `etc/` (deprecated)
  4. Observers & Events
- **Finding the Command for a Module**:
  - Check `di.xml` for CLI commands.
  - Use `bin/magento list`.
- **Magento Constructor Rules**: Define dependencies via `__construct()` and avoid using `ObjectManager` directly.
